## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I think you accidently stumbled upon my GitHub profile, or maybe you came here at your own will. Either way here's little bit about me.

My name is **Tanseer Saji** (you can see an accurate represention of my face right there in my GH Profile Picture). I am a Machine Learning Engineer based in Dubai, UAE. I mainly work using Python (duh...)

I am also co-author of a blog called **Idiomatic Programmers** ([Link](https://idiomaticprogrammers.com/))
